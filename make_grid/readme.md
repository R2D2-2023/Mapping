In this repository, you will find the code for creating a grid on which you can draw. The repository contains two folders: make_grid_c++ and make_grid_Python, each with their respective language variant.

## make_grid_c++
This folder contains the C++ implementation of the grid maker. You can find the source code and the necessary files to compile and execute the program.

## make_grid_Python
This folder contains the Python implementation of the grid maker. You can find the source code and execute it using a Python interpreter.

Feel free to explore the folders and choose the implementation that suits your needs. Have fun drawing on the grid.
